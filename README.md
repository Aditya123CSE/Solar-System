🔭 Solar System Explorer
This is an interactive, purely front-end visualization of the Solar System, showcasing orbital mechanics, relative planetary sizes, and astronomical data for each celestial body.

✨ Features
Full Solar System: Visualizes the Sun, eight major planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), the Moon, and the Asteroid Belt.

Interactive Panning: Navigate the scene using WASD keys or Click-and-Drag with the mouse to explore the orbits.

Time Control: Adjust the speed of the orbital simulation using the Time Speed slider.

Detailed Information: Click on any celestial body to display its key facts, including Diameter, Mass, Orbital Period, and Interesting Facts.

Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes and viewport changes.

🛠️ Technology Stack
This project demonstrates a complex, animated visualization using only core web technologies, without relying on external 3D libraries (like Three.js).

HTML: Structure and organization of the UI and data panels.

CSS: Styling, animations (stars, planet colors), and creating the 2D representation of orbits and the Saturn ring.

Vanilla JavaScript: Handles all dynamic logic, including orbital mechanics (Kepler's laws approximation), user input (WASD, drag, zoom), animation loop (requestAnimationFrame), and rendering the data.
